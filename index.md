## Introduction to GDAL/OGR

Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) provides command-line utilities to translate and process a wide range of raster and vector geospatial data formats. Traditionally, the name "GDAL" was used to refer to the raster-related half of the library, while "OGR" referred to the vector part. You may commonly hear people use both "GDAL" and "GDAL/OGR" to refer to this library - but in all cases, the toolset being referenced is the same.

Some common uses you may have for GDAL include: quickly getting basic information about a dataset, converting between geospatial file types, reprojecting data, clipping one dataset against another, and more.
