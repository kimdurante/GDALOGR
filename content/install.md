## Getting Started

* [Installing GDAL](#installing-gdal)
* [Workshop Data](#workshop-data)


## Installation

### Conda

GDAL can be quite complex to build and install, particularly on Windows and MacOS. Pre built binaries are provided for the conda system:

https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/

By the conda-forge project:

https://conda-forge.org/

Once you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed, you should be able to install GDAL with:

```$ conda install -c conda-forge gdal```


### pip

GDAL can be installed from the Python Package Index:

```$ pip install GDAL```

It will be necessary to have libgdal and its development headers installed if pip is expected to do a source build because no wheel is available for your specified platform and Python version.

To install the version of the Python bindings matching your native GDAL library:

### Windows

You will need the following items to complete an install of the GDAL Python bindings on Windows:

[GDAL Windows Binaries](https://www.gisinternals.com) - Download the package that best matches your environment.

As explained in the README_EXE.txt file, after unzipping the GDAL binaries you will need to modify your system path and variables. If youâ€™re not sure how to do this, read the Microsoft Knowledge Base doc

1. Add the installation directory bin folder to your system PATH, remember to put a semicolon in front of it before you add to the existing path.
    
    ```C:\gdalwin32-1.7\bin```
    
2. Create a new user or system variable with the data folder from your installation.

    ```Name : GDAL_DATA```
    
    ```Path : C:\gdalwin32-1.7\data```
    
 Verify that the installation was successful by opening a terminal and running the following command:
 
```
$ gdalinfo --version
```
